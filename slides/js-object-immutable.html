<h2>JS Object &lt;==&gt; Immutable</h2>

<pre><code class="lang-javascript" data-trim>
var myself = Immutable.Map({ name: 'Tom' });
// Instead of changing myself in-place
// like I would with vanilla JavaScript,
// Immutable provides methods that yield new modified objects.

var someoneElse = myself.set('name', 'Thomas');
// If you've dealt with this problem before,
// you might notice that there's another way
// of approaching this problem ==> by cloning objects:

var myself = { name: 'Tom' };
// clone myself, to ensure that changing someoneElse doesn't
// mutate it.
var someoneElse = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(myself));
myself.name = 'Thomas';
