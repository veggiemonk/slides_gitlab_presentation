<h2>History is a List with Index</h2>

<p>As simple as that: generally the start of the array is the first state, where there's no ability to go backwards, and the tip of the array is the present.</p>

<pre><code class="lang-javascript" data-trim>
var historyIndex = 0;
var history = [Immutable.Map({ name: 'Tom' })];
    // history doesn't need to be immutable!
</code></pre>
