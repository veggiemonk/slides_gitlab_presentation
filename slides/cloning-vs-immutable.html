<h2>Cloning vs Immutable</h2>

<pre><code class="lang-javascript" data-trim>
var myself = { name: 'Tom' };
var someoneElse = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(myself));
myself.name = 'Thomas';
</code></pre>

<h4>Immutable improves upon this hack with a guarantee and an optimization:</h4>

<ul style="font-size: 30px">
    <li>Immutable's methods like .set() can be more efficient than
        cloning because they let the new object reference data in the old object:
        only the changed properties differ.
        This way you can save memory and performance versus constantly deep-cloning everything.
    </li>
    <li>
        It's nearly impossible to accidentally mutate an Immutable object, and remarkably easy to accidentally forget to clone a normal object.
        Immutable objects give a strong guarantee that nowhere does anyone mutate data in-place.
    </li>
</ul>
